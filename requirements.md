#Â Requirements

We want to build first of all a CLI tool which creates a Kubernetes cluster with some features.
And we want to write this tool in [Go](https://golang.org).

We chose to create a cluster using [Kind](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/docs/user/quick-start/).

Then we'll add some new features, one by one.
